  <h3>Journal</h3>
  <p>7-6-2021: Doing some programming challenges on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/">r/DailyProgrammer</a>â€”I'm breaking out write-ups of each problem and solution into separate pages. I'm creating static images of code snippets using <a href="https://carbon.now.sh/">Carbon</a>. I like this tool a lot and it makes pretty code snippets. Apparently they have a CLI tool to generate the images instead of using their site. I'd like to try it out soon. I also learned some of the differences between PNG (raster) and SVG (vector) formats. The SVG outputs from Carbon look crisp even when you zoom in, but is 10x the file size of PNG.</p>
  <p>6-30-2021: Changed back to light mode. I feel like I'm going to go back and forth on this until I implement two themes and a mode toggle.</p>
  <p>6-25-2021: Reversed the background and text color. I had a light background and I turned on my computer at 6:00 AM. Oh no. If I had a changelog on this site, it'd say something like "Implemented Dark Mode".</strike> In reality it was swapping 2 CSS values. After I reversed the colors, I saw that the default HTML link colors contrasted poorly, so I set up new colors for 4 link states: link, hover, active, and visited.</p>
  <p>6-24-2021: It has colors now. I also added a test link <a href="posts/test.html">here.</a> I put up the social links now.</p>
  <p>6-23-2021: Today I connected my domain to Github Pages. I also set up some accounts for social media. Tomorrow I'd like to add some color to this website.</p>
  <h3>Some ideas for this site.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Change social links to icon-buttons(6-24-2021)</li>
    <li>Light-dark mode toggle (6-30-2021)</li>
  </ul>
